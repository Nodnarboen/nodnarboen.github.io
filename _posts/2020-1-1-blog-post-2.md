With the sound of fireworks behind me, I craft this post in an Airbnb room in Prague, en route to a training I will have in Linz.
Excited for what the future may hold, I consider the possibilities this coming year will bring for me and my family.
And while my wife lies asleep in the bed next to me, I sit on the lounge sofa wondering what brought us to this moment in time.

Random strangers walking and discussing their New Year plans. I pick up those chats through the thin windows that seperate us. 
Forgetting the huge difference in temperatures, I sit comfortably within a heated room listening to the excitement of many.
A moment in time that will be vastly different from my day-to-day in other normal weeks. I suppose this form of escapism is what most will find during a holiday.

And yet this little break is only made possible with the help of my family. My parents, in-laws, aunties and uncles chipping in to care for our 3 little ones while we sneak off to another world.
I am forever grateful to them for allowing this to be a reality for us.

And once we head back, our world will once again be thrown into disarray. Filled constantly with cries of frustrations, whiny expressions of needs and desires of my 3 children.
Which isn't a bad thing altogether, but I suppose I am just weary. And I am certain my wife can attest to that more than me.
The last holiday I could remember with just the both of us was our honeymoon. And that was nowhere remotely near where I am physically now.

So yes, I am soaking this all in. Trying to suppress my guilt for being away from my children yet unapologetically knowing that this is a long time coming and a definately hard earned getaway.
So as we pray, we know that that what we are in this moment on a stepping stone, crossing into another special year ahead of us.
We plan believing in the goals for this upcoming year and trusting God that He will aid us in carrying out our dreams and desires.

May this little break provide us what we need to face this new year.


Happy Neo Year everyone.
