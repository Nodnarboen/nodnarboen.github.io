Imagine having to move 2 heavy full size luaggages with 2 hand-carry bags on board a high speed train moving at 250km/h. 
We were moving from train cabin to cabin, train compartment to compartment, looking for a potential place to lay out heads for the next 13 hours. 
Suddenly, I felt the desperation of Joseph with Mary on that faithful night. The factors were all similar; a cold dark winter's night and in a foreign land. 
Except that I didn't have a pregnant wife about to give birth the savior of the world.
But yet, we were both pregnant with the desires of wanting a perfect holiday, to get to Rome and continue on the planned trip.

As the saying goes - When it pours, it rains.
I started the ball rolling with not double checking the class of the train that I booked in. 
That quickly escalated with many more wrong turns which led to the whole night eerily looking like a sob story or a horror movie.
We ended up having to make a u-turn, head back to Vienna and make all the necessary arrangements to cancel our accomodation in Rome and find lodging in Vienna.

It was painful. I wanted to escape, wanted to run away but I knew that I couldn't. I was stuck with so much dead weight. DEAD. WEIGHT. 
I wish I could just drop everything and go. Our luggages hindered our every move and at a certain point, I even lost one of our hand-carry bags
and I had to head back in an opposite train to go find it. That just dragged out the misery by another couple more hours. 
I had no certainity that I could find it and while sitting on the train, my mind was racing.
It was a domestic line and with each Austrian local train stop, I kept asking myself if this extra journey was worth it.
"What if I couldn't find it?" "I'm already so drained by this fiasco. Can't we just replace the items in it?"
"I'm not even certain where I lost it. What if someone had found it and taken it?"
I prayed and found the necessary courage and hope to bring me along this unnecessary added trip.

When I arrived at the location some 90 minutes later, I found the bag just sitting there on a bench.
"Thank you Jesus", I muttered under my cold breathe, instantly forming smoke as it leaves my mouth.
This entire disaster was made slightly more comforting and I had found hope that this might be the turnaround point.

In life, we constantly face challenges. To the many crossroads in life, we will need to find the fastest or easiest route to get to our destination.
I find that our decisions are hindered by the things we carry.
Trash like thoughts make the already mental baggage heavier. 
Or sometimes physical items we carry on our journey will need to be disposed of. 
How often do we find ourselves carrying extraneous items within our luaggages? I admit that I do.
I believe if we were to litter our paths with these negative thoughts, getting rid of things that we no longer need, that will make our journey easier. 
Perhaps Disney is on to something with Elsa's song in Frozen. 
If we could let go of our excess baggage, we might find ourselves in a better state of mind.
This leads to better decisions which will in turn lead to a better outcome.
I know we're educated to not to be a tosser, but this should be an exception. 

Let's do neo year spring cleaning.
