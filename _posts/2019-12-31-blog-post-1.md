What a year it has been. Looking further out, what a decade even. Many things has happened during these time period which evolved my life and I can't be more grateful for the 
opportunities I have been given. 

Cliche as it may sound, I wouldn't have imagined what my life would have been like a decade ago. More than just milestones, many momentous markers have 
been made within the past 10 years.

With a grateful heart, I look back and count the landmark events that happened:

* Birth of my first child Liam
* Birth of my second child Levi
* Migration to Sydney Australia
* Landing a a job with Ruxit
* Birth of my third child Lily

I honestly don't think there will be another decade in my lifetime that will hold that much crucial and important events. I thank God for each of these and though
all of them are positive in nature, these events have shaped and changed my life for the better (and worse). 
I look to cover these events in deeper nature in the coming posts ahead.

Here's me anticipating for a greater year but also greater decade ahead.
